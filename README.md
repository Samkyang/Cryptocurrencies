# Cryptocurrencies
#### An analysis using unsupervised machine learning for Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze the data of many cryptocurrencies to help make a decision on if they should invest in a certain coin. 


## Process
First we had to clean the data, and that started by dropping null values, using only coins that were tradable in the data. I also had to scale the data.

I found the K Mean which was 4. This let us know how many classes we should use to breakdown the data.

## Results
The results are still inconclusive as to which coin to invest in. But we were able to break down the data into 4 different classes to help us determine further which coin would be best to invest in.

## Summary
Overall this project helped me learn how to apply machine learning to an outcome that was unknown.
